机器学习🏫
different criteria not just accuracy🤯

brief introduction to bioinformatics /生物信息学
biological pathway needs big data
What is bioinformatics 
interdisplinary


Machine Learning 
1.machine learns sth through algorithm to predict data
2.programme -> big data -> improve their behaviour -> act like human beings
3.experience 此处更像是经验的意思 / data 就是之前发生的事件的数据 ⌚️
